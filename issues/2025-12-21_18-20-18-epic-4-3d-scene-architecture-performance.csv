A1,Extract shared scene helpers,"Create shared helpers for scene activity + FPS throttling + seeded RNG and reuse in hero/pass scenes","New shared modules exist and hero/pass import them (no duplicated definitions)","npm -C apps/web run check | npm -C apps/web run build",manual,TODO,TODO,TODO,"apps/web/src/components/scenes/lib/* | apps/web/src/components/scenes/hero-scene.tsx | apps/web/src/components/scenes/pass-scene.tsx",none,"Keep behavior identical (pause on scroll/offscreen/tab hidden)"
A2,Split pass scenes into modules,"Move Free Cassette + Premium Bonsai implementations out of pass-scene orchestrator","pass-scene.tsx only orchestrates Canvas + selects scene modules; visuals remain equivalent","npm -C apps/web run check | npm -C apps/web run build | manual: verify Free/Premium cards render",manual,TODO,TODO,TODO,"apps/web/src/components/scenes/pass/* | apps/web/src/components/scenes/pass-scene.tsx",A1,none
A3,Refactor hero scene into modules,"Reduce hero-scene size by extracting ramen generator/backdrop where sensible and use shared helpers","hero-scene.tsx uses shared helpers and extracted modules without changing visuals","npm -C apps/web run check | npm -C apps/web run build | manual: verify hero renders",manual,TODO,TODO,TODO,"apps/web/src/components/scenes/hero-scene.tsx | apps/web/src/components/scenes/hero/*",A1,none
A4,Standardize canvas performance presets,"Introduce reusable canvas presets (DPR, FPS target, gl flags, tone mapping defaults) for hero vs card canvases","All canvases use presets; cards are throttled by default and remain visually acceptable","npm -C apps/web run check | npm -C apps/web run build",manual,TODO,TODO,TODO,"apps/web/src/components/scenes/lib/* | apps/web/src/components/scenes/hero-scene.tsx | apps/web/src/components/scenes/pass-scene.tsx",A1,none
A5,Add optional lazy-mount for offscreen card canvases,"Mount card canvases only when in view; render a lightweight placeholder otherwise","Offscreen cards do not create WebGL contexts; on scroll into view scenes mount without errors","manual: run npm -C apps/web run dev; scroll page; confirm cards mount when visible and no console errors",manual,TODO,TODO,TODO,"apps/web/src/components/scenes/lib/* | apps/web/src/app/page.tsx",A1,none
A6,Introduce scene registry for cards,"Create typed registry for card scenes (tier, component, preset, camera config) to make adding new cards consistent","Adding a new card requires one registry entry + one scene module; page renders from registry","npm -C apps/web run check | npm -C apps/web run build",manual,TODO,TODO,TODO,"apps/web/src/components/scenes/registry.ts | apps/web/src/app/page.tsx",A2|A4,none
A7,Add unit tests for extracted generators/config,"Add Jest tests for deterministic outputs (seeded RNG, voxel/matrix generators, registry integrity)","New tests pass and cover determinism + basic invariants","npm -C apps/web test | npm -C apps/web run typecheck",manual,TODO,TODO,TODO,"apps/web/src/__tests__/* | apps/web/src/components/scenes/**",A1|A2|A6,none
A8,Document how to add new 3D cards,"Update docs explaining module layout, registry usage, perf presets, and why we keep R3F","Docs clearly explain how to add a new scene and performance guidelines","manual: read docs; optionally run npm -C apps/web run build to ensure no doc tooling breaks",manual,TODO,TODO,TODO,"apps/web/README.md | docs/*",A6,none
A9,End-to-end regression pass,"Run full checks and record manual QA notes for hero + card scenes","Regression_Status can be marked DONE after checks pass and manual QA is recorded","npm -C apps/web run check | npm -C apps/web run build | manual: verify hero + cards render",manual,TODO,TODO,TODO,"apps/web/*",A1|A2|A3|A4|A5|A6|A7|A8,"Manual QA includes: pause-on-scroll/offscreen and mobile sizing"
